# mohammad-portfolio
This is my first portfolio in my github. I tried to make it as good as I can. 

### I have made this portfolio in the following ways:
1. I put my name in H1 heading and inline with About me, work, contact, Resume.
2. I used anchor tag to see the specific element in those element.
3. In About me section, I write down something about me.
4. In Work section, I put my latest work which is Horisen Code Refactor and make it link it to the pages.
5. In my work section, I put some picture which is linked to googgle.
6. Work section linked to pages I used _target blank which can be open the website in a new page.
5. In contact section, I made a  form which is name, email, and subject included.
6. Finally, I tried to make it resposive.
